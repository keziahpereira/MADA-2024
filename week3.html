            <ul>
                <li><strong>Provide recipe suggestions</strong> based on available ingredients.</li>

            </ul>
        </section>
        <div class="content-container">
            <h2> Narrative and Structure</h2>
            <p>The primary objective of "The Student Pantry" is to empower students to make the most of the ingredients they already have, promoting sustainability and minimizing food waste. The website aims to help students create meals with available resources and educate them on the importance of using ingredients efficiently. Specific outcomes include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Users will learn to create meals from available ingredients, improving their cooking skills without needing extra purchases.</li>
                <li><strong>Experience:</strong> Students will interact with the platform by searching for recipes based on what they have on hand and engage in fun, interactive games while cooking.</li>
                <li><strong>Ability:</strong> The website will increase students' ability to cook with fewer resources and reduce food waste.</li>
                <li><strong>New Perspectives:</strong> The website will encourage students to think more sustainably about food and waste.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Audience Understanding</h3>
            <p>The target audience is primarily university students, especially at the University of Glasgow, with plans to expand to other universities. They likely have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic Cooking Knowledge:</strong> Most students are familiar with basic cooking techniques but may struggle with making meals from limited ingredients or within time constraints.</li>
                <li><strong>Interests:</strong> They may be interested in saving time, cooking efficiently, and reducing food waste. Sustainability may also appeal to them as it is a growing concern.</li>
                <li><strong>Lifestyle Needs:</strong> University students are often busy, live in shared housing, and are on tight budgets, making a focus on easy, cost-effective meals important.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Structuring The Narrative</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thematic:</strong> Organize the website around key themes like "Quick Meals," "Sustainable Cooking," and "Ingredients on Hand." This allows users to easily find relevant recipes or tips based on their immediate needs or concerns.</li>
                <li><strong>Methodological:</strong> Provide a clear, step-by-step process for each recipe, with easy instructions and difficulty levels to cater to users with different cooking experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive/Engaging:</strong> A waiting game while meals cook could be both a fun and practical tool. Features like "Ingredient Challenges" or "Leftovers Transformation" would engage students creatively.</li>
                <li><strong>Chronological:</strong> The website could feature a "meal prep journey" section, guiding users from ingredient selection to cooking, with each step accompanied by helpful tips or videos.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Audience Engagement</h3>
            <p>Given the student demographic, the content will use an informal tone, addressing users directly in the second person ("you"). Simple, friendly language will make the content feel approachable and encourage engagement.</p>
            
            <p>By considering these factors, "The Student Pantry" will be a structured, engaging platform that helps students enhance their cooking skills, save time, and embrace sustainable food habits while making the most out of what they have.</p>
